          Broadly, my academic research leverages publicly available data, natural history collections, and data
          science methods to better understand how biodiversity is changing in the Anthropocene. To date, I have
          focused primarily on how extinctions and introduction of non-native invasive species contribute to
          observed patterns of change.

        <h2 class="h2Tag">Why Herpetology?</h2>
        <h4 class="h4Tag">The reason why I focus on amphibians and reptiles</h4>

        <p class="normalPara">
          As far back as I can remember, I have always felt a strong interest in reptiles and amphibians. These
          organisms are great examples of the diversity and adaptability that can be found in nature. As a result,
          they are incredible focal taxa for studying how organisms interact and respond to their environments.
        </p>

        <p class="normalPara">
          In this day and age, the need to be “eco-aware” is global. Often, an environment will shift in response
          to rapid change, and the way species react can indicate what is to come. Much like canaries in coal mines,
          amphibians and reptiles have become prime examples of such species, which makes them great model
          organisms. By understanding patterns in herpetofauna, we can make sense of broader ecological phenomena
          that can be applied to other systems as well.
        </p>

        <p class="normalPara">
          In the iEcoLab, I have satisfied my life-long penchant for amphibians and reptiles through the study of
          Caribbean lizard extinctions and pursued new taxonomic horizons through investigations of the relationship
          between the spotted lanternfly (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>) and its plant hosts.

            Paninvasion severity assessment of a U.S. grape pest

          </h2>

          <h4 class="h4Tag">Abstract</h4>

          <p class="normalPara">
            Economic impacts from plant pests are often felt at the regional scale,
            yet some impacts expand to the global scale through the alignment of a pest’s
            invasion potentials. Such globally invasive species (i.e., paninvasives) are
            like the human pathogens that cause pandemics. Like pandemics, assessing
            paninvasion risk for an emerging regional pest is key for stakeholders to
            take early actions that avoid market disruption.
          </p>
          <p class="normalPara">
            Here, I develop the paninvasion severity assessment framework and use it to
            assess a rapidly spreading regional U.S. grape pest, the spotted lanternfly
            planthopper (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>; SLF), to spread and disrupt the global
            wine market. I found that SLF invasion potentials are aligned globally because
            important viticultural regions with suitable environments for SLF establishment
            also heavily trade with invaded U.S. states. If the U.S. acts as an invasive
            bridgehead, Italy, France, Spain, and other important wine exporters are likely
            to experience the next SLF introductions. Risk to the global wine market is high
            unless stakeholders work to reduce SLF invasion potentials in the U.S. and globally.

          </h2>

          <h4 class="h4Tag">Abstract</h4>

          <p class="normalPara">
            Global impacts of invasive insect pests cost billions of dollars annually,
            but the impact of any individual pest species depends on the strength of
            associations with economically important plant hosts. Estimating host
            associations for a pest requires surveillance field surveys that observe pest
            association on plant species within an invaded area.
          </p>
          <p class="normalPara">
            However, field surveys often miss rare hosts and cannot observe associations
            with plants found outside the invaded range. Associations for these plants
            instead are estimated with experimental assays such as controlled feeding
            trials, which are time consuming and for which few candidate hosts can be
            tested logistically. For emerging generalist pests, these methods are unable
            to rapidly produce estimates for the hundreds of potential suitable hosts that
            the pest will encounter as it spreads within newly invaded regions.
          </p>
          <p class="normalPara">
            Here I use phylogenetic imputation to estimate potential host associations in
            an emergent generalist forest pest in the U.S., the spotted lanternfly
            (<em>Lycorma delicatula</em>; SLF). Known host associations exhibit phylogenetic
            signal, allowing imputation to estimate association strength for hundreds of
            candidate tree species. I highlight clades and regions in the U.S. where
            host associations are predicted to be strong, providing a roadmap for survey
            and experimental efforts.

          </h2>

          <h4 class="h4Tag">Abstract</h4>

          <p class="normalPara">
            The rate of extinction is accelerating in the Anthropocene. Humans have
            greatly intensified extinction pressures, making efforts to detect general
            non-random patterns of extinction increasingly important. Much research has
            focused on detecting which characteristics make some species more likely to
            go extinct than others, such as large body size and slow reproductive rate in
            animals, or limited dispersal range and narrow habitat requirements in plants.
          </p>
          <p class="normalPara">
            Here, I adapt the three general models of natural selection to classify
            non-random extinction as directional, disruptive, or stabilizing extinction.
            I develop a quantitative method for testing which of these models best
            describes observed extinction data and apply it to the Caribbean lizard genus
            <em>Leiocephalus</em> as a case study.
          </p>
          <p class="normalPara">
            Past extinctions in <em>Leiocephalus</em> show directional extinction of large-bodied
            species, while future-predicted extinctions exhibit a pattern similar to
            stabilizing extinction with respect to body size and limb proportions. This
            shift from directional to stabilizing extinction is consistent with hunting,
            introduced predators, and habitat loss that first increased extinction
            pressure on the largest species, and then on species that deviate from an
            adaptive peak centered on a generalist ground-lizard body plan.
